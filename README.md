# BPM-RLE-COMPRESSOR

A simple command-line C++ application for compressing and decompressing BMP images using Run-Length Encoding (RLE). This project demonstrates binary file I/O, image format handling, and lossless compression using modern C++.

## Features

- Compresses BMP images into `.rleimg` format using run-length encoding
- Embeds the BMP header within the compressed file, removing the need for external references during decompression
- Decompresses `.rleimg` files back into valid BMP images
- Command-line interface for compression and decompression
- Includes PowerShell scripts for compilation and cleanup

## Build Instructions

To build the project using the provided PowerShell script:

```powershell
.\COMPILE.ps1
```

This compiles all `.cpp` source files and creates `rlec.exe` in the root directory.

## Usage

### Compress a BMP Image

```bash
rlec.exe compress input.bmp output.rleimg
```

- `input.bmp`: Path to a uncompressed BMP file
- `output.rleimg`: Destination path for the compressed image

### Decompress a Compressed Image

```bash
rlec.exe decompress output.rleimg restored.bmp
```

- `output.rleimg`: File previously generated by the compressor
- `restored.bmp`: Output path for the decompressed BMP image

### Show Help Menu

```bash
rlec.exe --help
```
